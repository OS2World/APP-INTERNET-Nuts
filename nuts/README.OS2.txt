This is version 3.3.3 of the NUTS (Neil's Unix Talk Server) talker server. It includes a pre-compiled OS/2 executable. The source code required very little modfication. 

Requires:
Any version of OS/2 that will run EMX.
EMX 0.9c, available from Hobbes (ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu), in the /pub/os2/dev/emx/v0.9c/ directory. Enjoy!!
An HPFS partition.

To use: Unzip the binary (use infozip) and type "nuts333". Telnet to yourself (port 7000) and login as "fred" with password "test". Play around with it and read the documentation. This server is pretty easy to use and modify. Best of luck!
