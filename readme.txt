To setup and install NUTS/2 v3.3.3, simply type install x: (where x: is the drive you wish NUTS to reside on)
EMX runtime v0.9c is required.

Note: The install drive MUST be an HPFS partition, and a copy of infozip unzip must be in the path.
If you do not have infozip, you'll need to get it from Hobbes.


install.cmd syntax:
install x: no-icon

x: - Drive letter you wish to install to.
no-icon - If specified, install will not create a desktop icon for NUTS.
